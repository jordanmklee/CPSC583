## Understand the Data

1. The data includes unemployment rates as a percentage of the total labour force in various countries over the years of 1995-2004, separated into 4 categories: native men, foreign-born men, native women, and foreign-born women. 
   - **Country** is a dimension and nominal variable, since there is no intrinsic ordering. 

   - **Year** is a dimension and a quantitative-interval variable, since there is an order and an arbitrary zero. Measurement is not useful, but the intervals between them are.

   - **Native/Foreign-born Men/Women** is a dimension and nominal variable, because they are categories and one category cannot be ranked above or below another.

   - **Unemployment rate** is a measure and a quantitative-ratio variable, as it is a percentage. There is a meaningful origin (0%) and it represents an amount.

2. There are missing data points throughout the table, which may pose a challenge when representing the entire dataset. As well, the intervals between the years are not the same. The range is from 1995-2004, but years 1996-1999 and 2001-2002 are not present. There is also a large amount of countries, so if everything is overlaid in the visualization it could be difficult to distinguish between certain information.

## Manipulate and Visualize the Data

3. Sketches

4. Visualize

## Reflect on Your Visualization

5. Explain choice of visual language (refer to Bertin and Mackinlay)

6. Explain use of space (refer to Tuftes)

7. Explain what your visualization shows, note trends or outliers
