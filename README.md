# CPSC583

Assignments and project completed for CPSC 583 - Data Visualization, taken at the University of Calgary in Winter 2021.

## Assignments

### A1 - Unemployment Rates

An information visualization created from tabular data. Potential ideas are explored using the 5+5 method, before being implemented in D3.js. Includes data analysis, and reflection on design choices as well as the visualization.

### A2 - Modifying D3

Given an existing visualization, modified how the D3 JavaScript library created axes to produce a visually distinct axis compared to D3's implementation.

## Project

### P1 - Data Approval

Proposal for a Tour de France historical dataset found on Kaggle. Explains dataset information, and pros/cons.

### P2 - Sketching

Exploring possible design directions by sketching subsets using the 10+10 method. Discusses creating sketchable subsets, process and results.

### P3 - Implementation, Representation, & Presentation

Implemented 3 variations following the design direction from P2's refined sketches, with focus on representation/presentation and minimal interaction. Reflects on design process so far, and how implementation plays a role in revisions.
