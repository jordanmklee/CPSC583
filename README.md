# CPSC583

Assignments and project completed for CPSC 583 - Data Visualization, taken at the University of Calgary in Winter 2021.

## Assignments

### A1 - Unemployment Rates

[Demo](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/A1_Unemployment_Rates/src/index.html)

An information visualization created from tabular data. Potential ideas are explored using the 5+5 method, before being implemented in D3.js. Includes data analysis, and reflection on design choices as well as the visualization.

### A2 - Modifying D3

[Demo](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/A2_Modifying_D3/code/index.html)

Given an existing visualization, modified how the D3 JavaScript library created axes to produce a visually distinct axis compared to D3's implementation.

### A3 - Modifying Visualization

[Demo](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/A3_Modifying_Visualization/code-assignment3/index.html)

Given an existing visualization, modified it to include interaction in the form of brushing and linking.

## Project

### P1 - Data Approval

Proposal for a Tour de France historical dataset found on Kaggle. Explains dataset information, and pros/cons.

### P2 - Sketching

Exploring possible design directions by sketching subsets using the 10+10 method. Discusses creating sketchable subsets, process and results.

### P3 - Implementation, Representation, & Presentation

[Demo: Variation 1 - Paths](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/P3_Implementation_Representation_and_Presentation/src/paths.html)

[Demo: Variation 2 - Spokes 1](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/P3_Implementation_Representation_and_Presentation/src/spokes1.html)

[Demo: Variation 3 - Spokes 2](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/P3_Implementation_Representation_and_Presentation/src/spokes2.html)

Implemented 3 variations following the design direction from P2's refined sketches, with focus on representation/presentation and minimal interaction. Reflects on design process so far, and how implementation plays a role in revisions.

### P4 - Interaction

[Demo](https://jordanmklee.github.io/CPSC583/P4_Interaction/src/index.html)

Built upon variations created in P3 to incorporate more columns of dataset through interaction. Final report discussing entire process as well as reflection on the final implemented visualization.
